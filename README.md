This repo is configured to run from my mlab url that is currently stored in an environmental variable. You will need to configure your own environmental env or replace dbUri found in `config/index.json` with your own mongodb / mlab link. Uncomment "require('./models').connect(config.dbUri)" and comment "require('./models').connect(process.env.MLAB_URL)" from server.js if you want to connect to your database without using an Environmental Variable.
